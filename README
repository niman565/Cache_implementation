testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your three source files.
testhw places all of the results in results.txt in 
the directory with the source files in it.

This program is an implementation of both the DM (direct memory) and SA (set-associative) caches.
I collaborated with one other person to program this. This was made in C++. The testing files were
made by an outside source. To run, simply go into each of the individual files and run the respective
executables, followed by the name of the input file you wish to test. The outputs will be stored in files named "dm"- or "sa"- "-out.txt".
